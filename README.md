# RatioWeather

This is an Angular 6 weather app that pulls data from Bing maps api and Darksky api.

I created a responsive css and used Angular animations for creating a modal and carousel.

I used Rxjs for using observables.

To clone it locally:

git clone: `git@github.com:AlexVotry/ratio-weather.git`

`cd ratio-weather`

to run locally:

You need node version 8.9 or greater to run Angular 6.
If you have nvm:
`nvm install 8.9.0' (or higher 10.8.0 was stable at time of this writing)

`npm install`

`npm start`

go to localhost:3000
